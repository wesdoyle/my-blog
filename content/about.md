Hi, I'm Wes. I'm a software engineer and the Engineering Director at a software development agency called [PortalMedia](https://www.portalmedia.com). My current engineering interests include natural language processing, human learning, and search. I'm a mechanical engineer-turned-software engineer.

I'm the founder of [Productive Dev](https://courses.productivedev.com), a project that aims to provide immersive software engineering instruction with a focus on evergreen content, and remote mentorship. I also create content about engineering, DevOps, cloud, and machine learning on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/c/wesdoyle).

I enjoy writing and understanding software as a craft, and love helping other people do the same. Outside of work, I spend a lot of time [reading](/reading) and listening to music. Currently, I'm mostly interested in books about engineering, science, contemplative religious traditions, memoirs, and literary fiction.

I also enjoy spending time outside, [playing chess](https://www.chess.com/member/wesdoyle), and meditation.
