Hi, I'm Wes. I'm a mechanical engineer-turned-software engineer based in Wisconsin. I founded [SystemsLab](https://systemslab.cloud), a consulting practice that helps mission-driven organizations scale their impact through cloud, AI, and web development.

Outside of work, I spend a lot of time [reading](/reading), walking, and practicing meditation. Thanks for stopping by!
