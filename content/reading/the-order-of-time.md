A wonderful short book about our understanding of the nature of time, 
incuding a tour of general relativity, loop quantum gravity, and entropy.

I enjoy Carlo Rovelli's ability to balance and embed hard science 
into a form that feels visceral.

It's as if the science and history he writes about are the orchestra,
and the literature, poetry, and memories he draws upon are the 
vast walls of a concert hall.  The facts themselves resonate intensely against 
a somewhat tragic, or at least awe struck, subjective understanding of the world.
